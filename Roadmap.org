** INSTRUCTION FOR IMPLEMENTING NEW LEVELS.
*** Right now there are 10 levels pre-made.
**** I think 10 for now is enough, but more can be added at hearts desire.
***** Adding completely new levels requires a bit more work.
****** New Level scene must be created under Environment
****** New ObstacleWrapper must be created under Obstacles
****** New elements must be added to the arrays of various nodes (REMEMBER THAT ELEMENTS MUST BE ADDED TO ARRAYS AT THE DEEPEST LEVEL (TO THE ORIGINAL SCENE, NOT INSTANCE) SCENE/NODE.)
******* They must be assigned to the "Level Scenes" array, which is exported for the NextLevelButton node.
******** World->GUILayer->GameOverWrapper->NextLevelButton
******* Also World->CharacterLayer->MainCharacter array "Up Items" requires new item added for each level with the level basket items, which are intended to be sacrificed.
**** To modify 10 existing level assets.
***** Just go to 
****** Obstacles folder to modify ObstacleWrappers
****** Environment folder to modify Levels
****** Both Obstacle and Level scenes are named appropriately.
***** For level items modify World->CharacterLayer->MainCharacter (REMEMBER TO MODIFY THE ORIGINAL SCENE ARRAY, NOT INSTANCE) "Up Items" array elements of each level.
****** Remember that if array elements are references to Objects held in heap then to add a new unique item it is required to at first Choose new appropriate type object and only then drag in or load the asset.
***** To make level longer or shorter, just go to World->Level->FinishLine->ParallaxLayer mark all the FinishLine sprites and Shift arrow key move them back or forth.
****** Of course if level is longer then more content should be added to other parallax layers too.
**** First level setup instruction
***** Just replace existing World->Level node and World->CharacterLayer->ObstacleWrapper nodes with the first level scenes.
****** Remember to rename the Level to Level and ObstacleWrapper to ObstacleWrapper.
******* For example: Level2 should be named Level, when dragged in as the first Level, the same goes for ObstacleWrapper.
***** Modify Items as for any other level on the main character.
