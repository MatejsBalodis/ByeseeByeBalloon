  Is it really gonna be done? Probably not.
:END:
* DONE After merging with Matejs changes MainCharacter.tscn got ruined.
** I reset the git head and copied in my version of MainCharacter.tscn
*** So there may be differences to what Matejs did, but at least all items aren't shifted.
* DONE When spamming next level button too quickly game crashes.
** Probably have to forbid any behaviour after button is pressed and transition is happening.
* DONE Victory button appears after the last level.
* DONE Implement pause button. [6/6]
** DONE Quiet music
** DONE Restart button
** DONE Menu button

** DONE Change state(text) to unpause
* DONE Implement multiple levels. [5/5]
** INSTRUCTION FOR IMPLEMENTING NEW LEVELS.
*** Right now there are 10 levels pre-made.
**** I think 10 for now is enough, but more can be added at hearts desire.
***** Adding completely new levels requires a bit more work.
****** New Level scene must be created under Environment
****** New ObstacleWrapper must be created under Obstacles
****** New elements must be added to the arrays of various nodes (REMEMBER THAT ELEMENTS MUST BE ADDED TO ARRAYS AT THE DEEPEST LEVEL (TO THE ORIGINAL SCENE, NOT INSTANCE) SCENE/NODE.)
******* They must be assigned to the "Level Scenes" array, which is exported for the NextLevelButton node.
******** World->GUILayer->GameOverWrapper->NextLevelButton
******* Also World->CharacterLayer->MainCharacter array "Up Items" requires new item added for each level with the level basket items, which are intended to be sacrificed.
**** To modify 10 existing level assets.
***** Just go to 
****** Obstacles folder to modify ObstacleWrappers
****** Environment folder to modify Levels
****** Both Obstacle and Level scenes are named appropriately.
***** For level items modify World->CharacterLayer->MainCharacter (REMEMBER TO MODIFY THE ORIGINAL SCENE ARRAY, NOT INSTANCE) "Up Items" array elements of each level.
****** Remember that if array elements are references to Objects held in heap then to add a new unique item it is required to at first Choose new appropriate type object and only then drag in or load the asset.
***** To make level longer or shorter, just go to World->Level->FinishLine->ParallaxLayer mark all the FinishLine sprites and Shift arrow key move them back or forth.
****** Of course if level is longer then more content should be added to other parallax layers too.
**** First level setup instruction
***** Just replace existing World->Level node and World->CharacterLayer->ObstacleWrapper nodes with the first level scenes.
****** Remember to rename the Level to Level and ObstacleWrapper to ObstacleWrapper.
******* For example: Level2 should be named Level, when dragged in as the first Level, the same goes for ObstacleWrapper.
***** Modify Items as for any other level on the main character.
** DONE Implement level switching with next button.
** DONE Implement switching between levels. [2/2]
*** DONE Next level button.
*** DONE Implement specific set of items for each level.
** DONE Implement so that score is persistent between levels.
** DONE Next level button changing text to victory.
** DONE Implement so that if score is not sufficient (levels must have entry price) at level complete the game is over and it is not possible to go to next level. [3/3]
*** DONE If there isn't enough total points to enter the next level then player can restart level or go to menu, just like when he has fallen. [1/1]
**** DONE Character must become angry, instead of dead [2/2]
***** DONE Animation [2/2]
****** DONE Face
****** DONE Body (Red one - incline)
***** DONE Audio
*** DONE Implement so that total score/required score for the next level is displayed constantly in the corner and it updates in realtime showing if it is possible to get to next level. [12/12]
**** DONE Level 0 required score
***** 500
**** DONE Level 1 required score
***** 600
**** DONE Level 2 required score
***** 700
**** DONE Level 3 required score
***** 750
**** DONE Level 4 required score
***** 800
**** DONE Level 5 required score
***** 900
**** DONE Level 6 required score
***** 950
**** DONE Level 7 required score
***** 1000
**** DONE Level 8 required score
***** 1050
**** DONE Level 9 required score
***** 1250
**** DONE Total required score
***** 8500
**** DONE Total best merchant score required 10000
*** DONE Implement so that it is possible to reset level at which the not sufficient score was reached with the score that was at the level start.
* DONE Pressing menu made the pause button to appear on level complete.
* DONE Dropped item background disappears and item bar shrinks.
* DONE Item bar must not be draggable if invisible (White arrows should not appear)
* DONE White arrow appears too soon on the right side when the selection bar is less wide than the screen width.
* DONE Make a shader for the the item selection bar to fade out at the ends.
** All the shader param setting happens from item bar instead of each element.
*** Then I am passing to each next visible item it's previous element alpha (0 to the first one) and it's own alpha.
**** Then when that is tested, that just it's own alpha setting is used.
***** I use lerp in the shader and lerp from the previous alpha to current alpha using UV.x
* DONE There is still a problem that dropped items appear behind the background now.
** Problem is not the shader, problem is bar shrinking objects later in hierarchy are movedover the falling parts.
* DONE When there are no items in the bar the white arrow is still displayed, when the bar is dragged.
* DONE Also have to implement so that if mouse moves over the bottom bar the coefficient increases the strength of the effect.
** So that if mouse isn't over the bar there is no fading.
* TODO If mouse is over certain item, that item opacity must become full.
* TODO Add type hints to all variables.
* TODO Level complete items fade in and out instead of just popping in and out.
** Just look for all the visible = true/false places and make a list of all the specific items that must be managed and maybe they can be managed in a bunch.
* TODO Level value points must be tuned so that the growth of the total score is taken into account.
** Just add the whole previous level value to each next, so that if player plays well he makes his life easier in long term.
* TODO Disable next level button. [0/2]
** TODO Uncomment nextlevelButton setting visibility to false in MainCharacter in physics_process after this

** TODO Set invisible next level button at the beginning.
* IN-PROGRESS Musical improvements together with Nezvers.
** TODO Music must start later, to nicely loop.
*** Consult with Nezvers about exact beginning of the track.
** TODO Implement (if possible) new story music.
*** Maybe Nezvers can create story track too!
